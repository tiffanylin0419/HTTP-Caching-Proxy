request wierd format(do not belong to get, post, request): 400 error

need to check all recv and send return value, if <0, return NULL in handle function

if used small functions that contain recv and send, need to have a return value to tell the outside function if it worked correctly

handle conditions when expire_time & max_age_time Might not exist: need to check if time is empty before comparing it to the current time

request_directly function : use while loop for processing chunk data

handle multiple cache-control: give them  different priroty in the order of
1. No-store & private
2. No-cache
3. must-revalidate
4. Max-age
5. public

handle chunked data by using a while loop for receiving data from server and sending it back to the client

handle unchunked data by parsing the first received response and check if it contains the word "chunk" inside, if it does not, we do not go into the while loop mentioned above

bad response: send 502 to client
bad request: send 400 to client

Only caches when response is 200 ok

process max-stale in request
